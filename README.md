# custom-wordpress-theme
This is a custom WordPress theme I created for college. The idea was to have a modular theme that can be used primarily for a web developer while being adaptable to almost any medium.


The "at-portfolio-cpt" folder is the plugin developed to set up the administrative side of the "portfolio" pieces. This allows the user to add new content for their portfolio.

The "at-portfolio" folder is the custom theme developed to allow the user to customize to their style while allowing an easy-to-use UI for their content management.
